# Gif To Do

[] Find and add MORE gif exercises.
[] Try and find a replacement gif for lateral-lunges. Don't like the initial title screen
[] Find the better toe-toucher with a woman
[x] Try and find a replacement gif for plank-hip-dips. She pauses too much
[x] Save the most recent gif additions to data.json / local folder in case gifs get removed

# Design To Do

[x] Stub out design for "workout" page
[x] Settle on the CSS timer design, and how to change the time values
[x] Display a countdown timer after clicking "Start Workout"
[x] Stub out design for "home" page 

# Functionality To Do

[] Add a select/filter button to include dumbbells in workouts if desired.

[x] Show which round the workout is currenly on. 

I HAVE added sounds. BUT, I just don't love it. Doesn't work on iOS and makes the timers behave poorly on
certain devices, or slower connections. I have commented out the code for now.
[x] Add sounds to timers
    [x] A start sound at the beginning of each exercise round (ExerciseTimer)
    [x] A subtle tick/beep sound fro 3, 2, 1 at the end of each timer

[x] Add no-sleep to keep screen awake

[x] Figure out how to use setTimeout() to display one object in an array at a time
[x] Also how to add the selected rest timer before each move starts
[x] When use selects number of exercises, allow them to see the list of moves? YES. I created this.
